			<h2>Number Girl</h2>
			<p>The legacy behind Number Girl is a bittersweet one. In a short amount of time they rosed to the top of the Japanese indie scene perhaps becoming the one of the most influential bands at the time and then they vanished from the scene just as fast. Number Girl was short lived unfortunately, the band broke up after a span of 7 years but in that time they produced some of the greatest material to come from Japanese indie.</p>
			<p>The band is known for it's talented musicians, all these guys are aces at what ever instrument they happen to be using as a result this doesn't lend itself to well to chemistry. Number Girl is known for how well they clash as a unit especially during lives. Everyone essentially tries to out do each other and this contributes to the greatest Noise experience you're going to have. Number Girl's sound in general is hard to pin down though. Mukai loves distorting his vocals and the instruments but he never stays put in one genre so to speak. The band is known for reinventing themselves continuously after every album introducing new concepts and experiementing frequently. The band is also know for its masterful but frenetic drumming from Ahito Inazawa  who is considered the best drummer in modern rock.</p>
			<p>Number Girl in fact inspired the name of this site and some of the design choices was taken from their album art. Please, pay your respects to Number Girl.</p>
