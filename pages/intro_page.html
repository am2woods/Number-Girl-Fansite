			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			<p>Hello and welcome to Distortion Addict a site dedicated to the awesome genre of music that is Noise Rock!</p>
			<h2>What is Noise Rock?</h2>
			<p>Noise Rock is a derivative of punk rock that came around during the 1980's with legendary bands like Sonic Youth and Big Black at the forefront. Noise Rock makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance. It is often grouped in with post-hardcore mainly for sharing musical styles and coming from the same lineage. What you hear when listening is heavily distorted guitars producing very loud and aggressive sounds. Noise Rock compositions also frequently discards the usualy songwritting conventions and structures in fact some songs don't even sound like "songs" at all. The entire experience is very abrassive but I find it very uplifting and transcendent; a wise man described it as "I remember some times when I felt like when we played it was like surfing a big sonic wave. That's the feeling I associate with 'noise'." This is a sentiment I can appreciate and liken to my experience while listening to Noise Rock. For me, Noise Rock is all about that raw emotion and expression.</p>
			<p>Noise rock groups have a confrontational performance style which compliments the way their music sounds. Things like destroying instruments and confronting with the audience are common place at your typical performance. The image shown at the right of this page is exemplary. In contrast to the more ostentatious elements of punk fashion Noise Rock performers adopted a more utilitarian mode of dressing.</p>
			<p>This site is all about giving you sample sounds of bands that may be considered Noise or most definitely use Noise elements through composing. One band is Sonic Youth a definitive Noise band during the late 80s and the other 2 are Number Girl and Spiral Chord bands from Fukuoka Japan and personal favorites of mine. Enjoy!</p>
